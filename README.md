# File Explorer
This repository contains a simple File Explorer component built using React, TypeScript, and CSS, without relying on any external libraries. The component allows users to navigate through a structured file system, interact with files and folders, and perform basic file actions and is hosted on: https://rashmi988.github.io/file-explorer/

## Features
**File and Folder Rendering:** Uses a predefined data structure to render files and folders.
**Expandable Folders:** Users can click on folders to expand or collapse their contents.
**Active/Selected State:** Left-clicking on a file highlights it, indicating the active selection.
**Context Menu:** Right-clicking on files opens a popup menu that allows users to perform actions like copy, delete, and rename (actions are being console logged for now).
